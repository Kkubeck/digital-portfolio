```{tab-item} Things I Learned
- Working comfortably from the terminal was an absolute time saver to rebuild the website.
- Selecting and editing multiple items was essential for editing Markdown
- I can build a website, and host it on GitHub!
```

```{tab-item} Things i found difficult
- Despite days of trying I never got Myst {ref} to work. Most Myst formatting did not render on my set up. I ended up using traditional Markdown format for links and still have 6 warning  of missing myst.xref during my build.
- Editing metadata in a notebook was not as easy as described. A clear distinction should be made between running a ipynb file in JN or JL since editing metadata is different in both.
- Some instructions, such as those for the above table of content and/or were a little vague.
